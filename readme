Sirius/jsonb-msgpack
====================

	This is a simple adapter that adds support for the MessagePack binary format
	available at https://msgpack.org/ to Avaje Jsonb.

	If you include this JAR into your project (and with JPMS, the module-path),
	there are no further steps needed to be taken if you would like to use the
	default adapter settings; this adapter is located automagically with Java's
	ServiceLoader by Avaje Jsonb.

	Currently, the `msgpack-java` module is added as a Git submodule, meaning that
	you do not need to separately add that dependency to your project as it is a
	part of this source tree and the JAR artifact distributed on JitPack, however
	this does mean that you should even avoid also including that JAR as it could
	cause a clash unless you are using JPMS.

Adding the dependency
=====================

	module-info.java ===============
	requires io.avaje.jsonb.msgpack;
	================================

	Maven ====================================
	<repository>
		<id>jitpack.io</id>
		<url>https://jitpack.io</url>
	</repository>
	...
	<dependency>
		<groupId>cam.sirius</groupId>
		<artifactId>jsonb-msgpack</artifactId>
		<version>1u1</version>
	</dependency>
	==========================================

	Gradle ===============================
	maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
	...
	compile "cam.sirius:jsonb-msgpack:1u1"
	======================================

	SBT =========================================================
	resolvers += "jitpack" at "https://jitpack.io"
	...
	libraryDependencies += "cam.sirius" % "jsonb-msgpack" % "1u1"
	=============================================================

Public API
==========

	The public API consists of the following classes (package io.avaje.jsonb.msgpack):
		*	MsgpackAdapter
		*	MsgpackAdapterFactory
	These can be used to obtain readers and writers.

	MsgpackWriter uses a lazy-evaluation style of writing in order to support the model
	expected with JSON (where we can keep writing elements to an array or object before
	closing it), as MessagePack requires the size of a map or array to be known before
	adding elements as it appends only a header.

	Here is a mock of how MessagePack would handle a simple JSON structure:
		JSON:
			{
				"name": "John Doe",
				"age": 20,
				"locations": [
					{
						"id": 246813579024680246,
						"address": "28/32 High St N, London E6 2HJ"
					},
					{
						"id": 271828182827182818,
						"address": "Tollgate Rd, London E6 5JP"
					},
				]
			}
		Pseudo-MessagePack (where semicolon is used as a separator):
			MAP OF 3 ELEMENTS;
				"name"; "John Doe";
				"age"; 20;
				"locations"; ARRAY OF 2 ELEMENTS;
					MAP OF 2 ELEMENTS;
						"id"; 246813579024680246;
						"address"; "28/32 High St N, London E6 2HJ";
					MAP OF 2 ELEMENTS;
						"id"; 271828182827182818;
						"address"; "Tollgate Rd, London E6 5JP";

	As you can see here, there is no concept of a terminator. When a certain element will
	end is dictated right at the beginning with a length field. This is also how raw binary
	data is able to be written, as you can simply write a byte[] and have it be translated
	to a header, e.g., "BINARY with 928341902490120 bytes", and already know when to expect
	the stream to end.
